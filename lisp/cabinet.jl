;;; Commentary:

;; Note:
;;  The words "window" and "application" mean same
;;  thing,they are used interchangeablly. The word "item"
;;  means the item displayed on Cabinet, which corresponding
;;  to an application. The words "selected item" means the
;;  first item on Cabinet. The words "selected window" means
;;  the window corresponding to the selected item.

;; ** Start up
;;   Cabinet required `hqw-util.jl', it should have been published along
;; with Cabinet. To separate them apart, because hqw-util.jl's
;; independence, you may find it useful at other occasions.

;;   Put `hqw-util.jl' and `cabinet.jl' into your load directory,and

;;   (require 'cabinet)

;;   Use command `cabinet-switch' to start Cabinet.
;; To bind it to "W-s",copy the following line to your rc file.

;; (bind-keys global-keymap "W-s" 'cabinet-switch)

;; ** Cabinet Features.
;;   Cabinet has a similar interface with iswitch,it also adds
;; some own features, like:

;; 1) Support window icons to be shown
;;    Actually,this is my main motive to write Cabinet. For
;; People are apt to distinguish from images instead of
;; text.

;; 2) Support cycling among workspaces
;;   Most times the reason you create another workspace is
;; to make a bunch of applications distinguished from
;; others. It's a bad idear to mix them together to choose
;; from. The better one is only let you have applications of
;; current workspace,and enable you to cycle among
;; workspaces.
;;   Though, Cabinet afford you a choice: To toggle between
;; workspace-mode -- to just show windows of current workspace --
;; and all-mode -- to show all the windows. When in
;; workspace mode, the tag on split line is something like
;; 2/3, which means the largest workspace id is 3, and now
;; you are in workspace of id 2. When in all mode, the tag
;; should be "ALL".
;; Notice to make you cycle through workspaces,you should
;; set workspace boundary to 'wrap-around,put this in your
;; rc file:

;; (setq workspace-boundary-mode 'wrap-around)

;; 3) Distinguish windows for display from windows for
;; manipulation.
;;   Some applications, most time you are not inclined to
;; select them via Cabinet, for you already have a hot key
;; for them or other reasons, but somehow you just want to
;; see them there: being displayed on Cabinet. You may see a
;; split line on Cabinet, the items below it are windows
;; that you just want to display. This feature makes Cabinet
;; could somehow functions like a panel.

;; 4) Use forground color instead of tag to indicate window
;; status.
;;   Because the same reason for enabling icons. Because it
;; saves a charater's space.

;; 5) Enable users to manipulate a bunch of windows.
;; Use "Super-Spc" to mark the selected window, and use
;; procedure `with-marked-wl', you can manipulate
;; them. The marks will be cleared out after you quit
;; from Cabinet. Cabinet affords a procedure to tile marked
;; windows horizontally .

;; 6) Item format
;;   Item format is  like this :
;;       icon + window name + <window class> + viewport id + workspace id
;;   Variable `cabinet-item-text' controls what to append to icon.
;;   You are welcomed to reset it.

;; ** Cabinet Keymap
;;   I made the default keymap(cabinet-keymap) according to my
;; favour, So it's recommended to create yours. The easiest
;; way to get started will be to copy the default keymap
;; binding from the cabinet.jl, and modify it.
;; Most key bindings are obvious, while some need extra explanation.
;; Here is a list:
;;           "Super-v"    toggle workspace-mode and all-mode
;;           "Super-s"    cycle windows
;;           "Super-r"    reversely cycle windows
;;           "Super-S"     cycle workspaces.(Notice 'S' is capital)
;;           "Super-R"     reversely cycle workspaces.
;;           "Super-z"     toggle iconify property of selected window.
;;           "Super-SPC"   mark selected window
;;           "Super-x"     exchange windows-for-display and windows-for-manipulation
;;           "Super-g"    Same with "RET",but will restore stack order.
;;           "Super-t"   tile horizontally marked windows
;;           "Super-T"   tile vertically marked windows

;; ** For ones who want to extend cabinet keymap
;; You may notice, in keymap definition, there are a bunch of
;; procedures like `with-draw', `with-new-wlist' and so on. Yes,
;; it's comfusing and ugly, but it's flexible, it enables
;; you to extend cabinet-keymap at will. Anyway,I've tried
;; to make doc string clear to alleviate you aversion.:-)

;; ** Version list
;; Cabinet 1.0 2011.11
;; Cabinet 1.1 2011.12.16  fixed a bug

;; Enjoy!!
